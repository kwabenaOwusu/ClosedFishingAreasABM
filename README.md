# *Effects of Configuration, Timing, and Duration of Closed Fishing Areas on the Ecological and Economic Sustainability of the Artisanal Sardinella Fishery in Ghana*

## Purpose 
A prototype spatially explicit Agent-Based Model (ABM) that captures the main characteristics of an idealized artisanal fishery to the specific Ghanaian sardinella case. I plan to adapt the model to investigate the combined effects of different sardinella management policies based on different features of closing, including (1) spatial configurations (closure of whole fishing ground versus closure of spawning hotspots), (2) timing, and (3) duration. More specifically, I will use the model as a virtual laboratory to determine the policy (in terms of configuration, timing, and duration) that can optimize, simultaneously ecological and socioeconomic needs.

Closure of the individual sardinella spawning hotspots (B), and closure covering an area comprising all sardinella spawning hotspots and less extended than the whole IFA (C).  </em>

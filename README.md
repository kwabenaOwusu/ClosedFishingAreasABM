# *Agent-Based Model to Investigate the Effects of Configuration, Timing, and Duration of Closed Fishing Areas on the Ecologic and Economic Sustainability of the Artisanal Sardinella Fishery in Ghana.*

## Purpose 
We developed a spatially explicit ABM that captures the main characteristics of the Ghanaian artisanal Sardinella fishery. We used the model to investigate the spatial configurations of fishery closure, the timing (when to implement it) and the duration (for how long it must be in place) of the fishing closures that optimize, simultaneously, economic returns (in terms of catches) and ecologic benefits (in terms of maintaining the fish abundance stocks to sustainable levels) of the Ghanaian artisanal Sardinella fishery. Specifically, we examined the following spatial configurations of fishery closure: no closure of the Inshore Exclusion Zone (IEZ), full closure of the Inshore Exclusion Zone (IEZ), and  closure of Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Area (EBSA).

<!--
## Note
Closed_Fishing_Areas.py contains the model code and is the main script to run. It is implemented in python. It will generate three outputs named **final_pirogue_geodata.csv**, **updated_mpa_sim_data.csv**, and **updated_mpa_sim_movie.mp4** in your working directory containing data on catch/fish abundance dynamics of individual pirogues, aggregated data on catch/fish abundance dynamics, and video of the simulation (as well as snapshots of each computing time step of the simulation).  -->
